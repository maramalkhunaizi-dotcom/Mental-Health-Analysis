# Mental-Health-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze mental health text data, with a primary focus on depression detection. The study aims to identify depressive patterns in user-generated text using machine learning, text preprocessing, and text representation methods.

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available mental health dataset collected from Kaggle, including depression-related posts. These datasets are commonly used in mental health NLP research.
Dataset source:
- Kaggle: Mental Health Social Media Dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/mental-health-social-media/data 

## Methodology
- Text preprocessing (basic data cleaning, stop words removal, tokenization, lemmenization, and TF-IDF)
- Feature extraction and text representation (POS tagging, N-grams, and bag of words)
- Machine learning model training (multilingual naive bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machine)
- Model evaluation using standard performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and confusion matrix)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLP libraries (NLTK and SpaCy)

## How to Run the Project
## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure the dataset is downloaded from the `data/` folder.  
   - The original and cleaned datasets are already included in the folder, or  
   - Alternatively, the original dataset can be downloaded from the provided source link.
3. Open `mental_health_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab).
4. Run all cells in order.
