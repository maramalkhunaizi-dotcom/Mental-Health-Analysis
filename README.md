# Mental-Health-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze mental health text data, with a primary focus on depression detection. The study aims to identify depressive patterns in user-generated text using machine learning, text preprocessing, and text representation methods.

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available mental health dataset collected from Kaggle, including depression-related posts. These datasets are commonly used in mental health NLP research.

## Methodology
- Text preprocessing (basic data cleaning, stop words removal, tokenization, lemmenization, and TF-IDF)
- Feature extraction and text representation (POS tagging, N-grams, and bag of words)
- Machine learning model training (multilingual naive bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machine)
- Model evaluation using standard performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and confusion matrix)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLP libraries
